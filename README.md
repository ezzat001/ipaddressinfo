ipaddressinfo
Getting information about a specific ip address and you can detect the location on the map using longitude and latitude
<br>
its very simple just enter the ip address to get information about , if you wanna get information about yourself just type "me" and 
press enter<br>

it will give you too many information about that IP Address and the Longitude and Latitude which you can use at any of those two sites<br>
to Locate the Device on the Map<br>
